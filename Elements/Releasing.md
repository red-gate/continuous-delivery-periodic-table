##D - Drift
Version-drift (or Version-creep) is the habit of 'patching' the production database to make any type of change without deploying it properly. The change could be as innocent as adding or changing an index to aid performance, but any change to production that hasn't gone through the normal release channels is 'Drift'. At the simplest level, when we detect version-drift, we are discovering that the version in production is not the version we think it is.
